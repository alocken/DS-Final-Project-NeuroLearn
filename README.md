# DS-Final-Project-NeuroLearn
Deep learning image recognition model that analyzes MRI scans to detect/classify brain conditions using learned image features. 

# Project Scope
Focus on one type of brain condition to build a targeted model for. Focus will look at building a model to identify when an image is a brain glioma in a Basic Color Map dataset versus another brain condition. The images will include both brain glioma and other types of brain conditions (specifically brain meningioma). 
Brain glioma refers to a type of tumor that originates in the glial cells of the brain, which provide support and protection to neurons. Gliomas are often aggressive and can occur in various parts of the brain, leading to symptoms like headaches, seizures, and cognitive impairments.

# Datset
Brain Cancer MRI Colorized Dataset

focus: Brain Glioma - Basic Color Map (2004 files)

Basic Color Map
Applies a standard color palette (like Jet or Viridis) to grayscale data. Different intensities are mapped to different colors, enhancing the visual discrimination of anatomical or pathological regions in the image.
