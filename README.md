# DS-Final-Project-NeuroLearn
Deep learning image recognition model that analyzes MRI scans to detect/classify brain conditions using learned image features. 

# Project Scope
Focus on one type of brain condition to build a targeted model for. Focus will look at Brain Glioma's Basic Color Map dataset to build, test, train model. 

# Datset
